  1. What is ‘good’ screen-based design?

  Make more convenience to our daily lives. For example online shopping, searching engines, and social networks that able to contact our friends beyond the sea.

  I think it is based on the viewer’s demands in order to make web more fit to their intended audience and customers, so I think the web have changed and still changing graphic design over time.
