  <h4>1. What is 'good' screen-based design?</h4>
  <p>Clear topic and straight forward.</p>
  <h4>2. How is art-making online different then art-making offline?</h4>
  <p>I think art-making offline seems to be more manual, and online is more technical.</p>

  <h4>5. How does the web impact graphic design?</h4>
  <p>I think it is based on the viewer's demands in order to make web more fit to their intended audience and customers, so I think the web have changed and still changing graphic design over time.</p>

  <p>Yes, people in my country are able to access to the internet. However, we could not use Google, Youtube, Facebook, and other social networks in China.</p>
